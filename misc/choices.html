<h1>Technology Choices and Solutions</h1>
</ul><h4><p>Free Speech - Fake News in Social Media</p></h4>

<p>There is many choices that can be made in order to solve this problem for society.</p>
    
<p>Governments regulations on false information on social media can reduce the spread of false information on the internet. However there can be governmental overreach if regulation and laws are taken too far in combatting fake news.</p>
    
<p>Have platforms that show fake news accountable. More moderation on social media websites. Fake news can be flagged as being "disputed" tag and the viewer is warned of the content might be false. X known formerly as X has a Twitter fact check where whether false information is posted it maybe community noted where true information is posted with the false information. People who constantly post false information may be banned temporally and prevented from posting anymore false information. However there is a problem to this as this moderation could impact the nature of freedom of speech on the internet.</p>
    
<p>Algorithms shouldn't be on social media or should be transparent. Many of the Social media curate their content depending on the user. The algorithms behind this shouldn't be on there or should be transparent to reduce and mitigate the spread of false information.</p>

<p>Algorithms and AI can reduce and slow the spread of false information by automatically flagging and adding true information onto the false information. Eugenio Tacchini and colleagues say it is possible to identify hoaxes with a high degree of accuracy. Testing this proposition with a database of 15,500 Facebook posts and over 909,000 users, they find an accuracy rate of over 99 percent(2017B). This is a very high chance of fake news detection, but it does have a 1 percent chance of being a false negative. However there can be false positives and true negatives. True information can be flagged as false and false information can be flagged onto the true information. Another survey suggest that of 7,500 individuals undertaken by David Rand and Gordon Pennycook of Yale University says that just 3.7 percent of partcipants more likely to correctly judge the headlines as false(2017C).</p>  

<p>Media and journalist can be encouraged to make more high-quality journalism that regains more trust and reliability. But however high-quality journalism takes more work and time than low-quality clickbait fake news. Fake news usually spreads faster than true news since it doesn't take a alot of effort to post fake news.</p>
    
<p>Some media can try to counteract the spread of false news by fact checking fake news for example nonprofit websites, factcheck.org and Snopes. Research by Dartmouth College Professor Brendan Nyhan has found that labeling a Facebook post as “disputed” reduces the percentage of readers believing the false news by 10 percentage points (2017A). </p>
    
<p>As many of the fake news on the social especially on social media is profitted off or the poster gains something out of posting false information. Social media companies can make it harder for these fake news posters to profit off their own fake news by making it harder for fake news to get ads on them. </p>
    
<p>Social media users can be educated more on fake news on social media and the dangers of it. However this solution will take a long time for it take effect onto society and it might not actually work by itself. Research done by oseph Kahne and Benjamin Bowyer suggests that predeterminted beliefs and perceptions is more persuasive than assessments (2017D). Social media users can also try to have a wide view on the content they consume instead of consuming content for a small limited viewpoint. This won't entirely solve the problem however it does prevent 'echo chambers' from forming. Users should be more skeptical on the content they consume especially content that agrees with their original viewpoint. The user must understand that everything in the news may not be entirely accurate and also most news are not entirely inaccurate either and must use other sources in conjuction to find a correct judgement.</p>

<p>There are no single solution to combatting fake news on social media and there is no true way of eliminating fake news in entirely. However it is the combination of solutions to this can slow the spread of false information. Many of these solutions have problems in themselves so using many solutions in tandem may reduce these negatives. False information can also be very helpful since it can be compared to true news and make people more perceptive to false news.</p>
