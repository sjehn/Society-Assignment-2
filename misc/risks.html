<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

</ul><h4><p>Free Speech - Fake News in Social Media<p></h4>
    
<p>There are many risks in fake news in social media</p>
<p>Misinformation in this day and age is easily spreadable and can travel afar. The result of this cause would most likely influence people's daily opinion on general things / important causes. This in turn is a negative as they could easily believe what's being brought into the table without verifying the source of information and simply dubbing it as “the truth”. With fake news being a common occurrence in society today, it could easily peoples trust on whom it has targeted and cause irreversible damage if not taken care of sooner. The reputation of governments, high profile doctors, scientists and even our own citizens could be tarnished.  </p>

<p>A great example of this situation would be the global problem of Climate Change and the Coronavirus (Covid-19). According to this researched conducted by Yasmim Mendes Rocha, Gabriel Acacio de Moura, Gabriel Alves Desiderio, Carlos Henrique de Oliveria, Francisco Dantas Lourenco and Larissa Deadame de Feguiredo Nicolete, the occurrence of Covid 19 heavily impacted the state of online news, with the spread of misinformation being prominent during those times, would lead to a massive surge of information which would be comprised of either truth or false being told to several news outlets. While verification of information was such an easy thing to say, it was really hard to perform. The main causes of misinformation being spread out so far and so easily would be due to Social Media platforms. Throughout the article, the app “Facebook” was mentioned as a prominent candidate of spreading misinformation throughout the reign of Covid-19, this would make things more difficult and keep spreading false information. As the article highlights, social media platforms—especially Facebook—played a major role in the dissemination of false or unverified information during the Covid-19 pandemic. This widespread dissemination contributed to the negative effects of the infodemic on society by increasing public confusion and impeding efforts to verify the accuracy of the information.  </p>

<p>In addition to posing a serious risk to public health, false information during the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on social dynamics and racism. Because of the infodemic, people of Asian descent experienced harsh and unfair treatment, which further fueled xenophobia and discrimination. Because of false information and preconceived notions, Asians were unjustly singled out for stigmatization and discrimination. This prejudice not only negatively impacted people's health but also hindered collective efforts to contain the pandemic. It serves as a sobering reminder that, in addition to spreading false information, misinformation can also incite bias, hatred, and social divisions. In order to address the problem of misinformation, we must first recognize how it contributes to racism and then work to make sure that accurate, unbiased information is readily available so that future injustices of this kind are avoided. </p>
    
<p>Beyond just being disinformation, fake news has far-reaching effects in the current digital era. Fake news not only disseminates inaccurate or misleading information, but it also reinforces and magnifies preexisting narratives and beliefs. This phenomenon creates what's known as a 'echo chamber.' An echo chamber is a place where people are primarily exposed to information that reinforces their preexisting opinions and beliefs. The echo chamber effect is particularly apparent in the social media sphere, where algorithms driven by artificial intelligence play a significant role in content curation. </p>
<p>According to the article authored by Chaowei Zhang, Ashish Gupta, Christian Kauten, Amit V. Deokar, and Xiao Qin, In the digital the increasing ubiquity of false information is cause for serious concern. The deliberate fabrication of statements to pass for facts is known as fake news, and it flourishes in an atmosphere where the desire for content to go viral—often spurred by monetary, social, or political advantages—is the driving force behind it. Since social media platforms are used to alter real news or create wholly false narratives, they have emerged as a crucial conduit for the dissemination of fake news. Fake news is spreading widely on social media, which puts both people and businesses at serious risk. It is difficult to identify and successfully combat false news because of its diversity and inventiveness. People can be misled, have their perceptions of reality distorted, and have their decision-making processes influenced by false information. </p>

<p>While the issue of Covid-19 remains a major concern, the link between climate change misinformation is equally serious. The authors of this article, Lauren Lutzke, Caitlin Drummond, Paul Slovic, and Joseph rvai, shed light on the pressing issue of climate change misinformation. The spread of false or misleading information in the field of climate science, similar to the case of Covid-19, can have serious consequences. This misinformation has the potential to stymie effective climate action, distort public perceptions of the climate crisis, and stymie the adoption of sustainable practices. Addressing this issue is critical because combating climate change is inextricably linked to combating misinformation and ensuring that the public receives accurate information in order to make informed decisions and prioritize a sustainable future. </p>

<p>Climate change misinformation is a serious threat to society and the planet as a whole. The spread of false or misleading climate science information can have far-reaching and negative consequences. For starters, it can stymie effective climate action by sowing doubt and confusion, resulting in late or inadequate responses to the climate crisis. Second, it distorts public perceptions of climate change's urgency and severity, leading to complacency and inaction. Furthermore, misinformation can have economic consequences because industries and policymakers may make decisions based on incorrect information. It also makes it more difficult to implement sustainable practices and policies, perpetuating our reliance on fossil fuels and exacerbating environmental degradation. </p>

<p>To summarize, misinformation has a wide-ranging and severe impact on society. It endangers public health, disrupts social dynamics, and even perpetuates racism. Misinformation creates a breeding ground for fake news, distorting reality and influencing decision-making processes, posing significant challenges. As a result, it is critical to address this issue as soon as possible, and social media platforms must take responsibility for limiting the spread of false information. Simultaneously, climate change misinformation poses a formidable challenge to our ability to effectively combat climate change. In this digital age, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of information is critical to ensuring our planet's and society's long-term viability. </p>
