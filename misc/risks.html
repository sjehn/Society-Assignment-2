<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

</ul><h4><p>Free Speech - Fake News in Social Media<p></h4>
    <p>Misinformation can be spread very fast and very widely, this can influence's people's opinions before it could be proof-read by credible sources.​</p>

<p>Fake news can break trust and confidence in governments, scientist, doctors and people. For example, denial in Climate Change and the Coronavirus. According to research done by the University of Melbourne, misinformation about COVID-19 has not only contributed to the spread of false remedies, but has also put the blame on governments and even racial groups.​</p>

<p>Fake news can reinforce, and favor predispose narratives and beliefs. This creates an 'echo chamber' where people always see what they want to see.​</p>

<p>Many bad actors could use fake news and misinformation to serve their agenda. This can impact elections and public opinion. A prime example would be the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp incident.​</p>
