<h1>Free Speech - Fake News in Social Media</h1>

 <p>Free speech is the right to express any opinions or beliefs without the fear of censorship and restriction and is considered a basic human right that is protected in many parts of the world. It is the foundation of democratic societies and encourages ideas that contribute to the progression and innovation of a more tolerable society. While this concept is valued in many nations, it stays significant and is most relevant today, as our world evolves and progresses through the modern era of technology.
 <p>Free speech gives a wide range of expressions, which include journalism, written communication, spoken words, and social/digital media. Not only does free speech give voices to popular opinions, but also unacknowledged and controversial opinions. This allows for the open discussion of ideas, which encourages critical thinking and enables society to evolve and be more open to new societal norms. Through the evolution of modern society, digital spaces have been created such as social media platforms, 
 online forums for discussions, and online articles. This has granted users the power to access information and to express their opinions publicly. However, there are multiple challenges to the aim of a more tolerable society, one of which is the spread of false information.</p>
    
<p>Fake news is one of the challenges that came with the era of our modern and virtual society. Fake news are news or stories that is false and meant to influence the reader in a certain way. Most of the fake news is meant to show an agenda or belief, causing confusion and distrust to the publisher.
Fake news in social media may masquerade as reputable sources of information while it's not. This can decieve people into trusting them. Fake news can also sow distrust within media, governments and people.
Fake news in social media is different from news sources from media journalists because media and journalists that are usually vetted and follow a strict code of practices, having a reputation behind them. However, fake news in social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Tiktok and other virtual platforms can come from anonymous people that don't need to show their faces, and their sources of information. Information shared within social media apps don't have to be edited, fact-checked or regulated. 
Because of these reasons, fake news in social media can be spreaded much faster than the news provided by media outlets, journalists or newspapers.</p>
    
<p>Most of the Fake news in social media is focused on a particular group of people. This can split individual groups and stimulate belief. This may encourage discord and violence amongst certain groups of people.</p>
