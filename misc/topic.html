<h1>Free Speech - Fake News in Social Media</h1>


</ul><h5><p>The page or area describing your chosen technology/topic and why it is significant and/or has important implications for society.<p></h5>

<p><em>When deciding on your chosen technology/topic, it is best not to choose something too broad, but limit the focus e.g. consider the level of social analysis from the figure below.</p></em>
<p>What is Free speech?</p>
    
 <p>Free speech is the right to express any opinions or beliefs without the fear of censorship and restriction and is considered a basic human right that is protected in many parts of the world. It is the stepping stone of democratic societies and encourages ideas that contribute to the progression and innovation of a more tolerable society. </p>
    
<p>However Free Speech especially in Social Media may negatively impact society. Fake news is one of the results of this free speech. Fake news is news or stories that is false and meant to influence the reader in a certain way. Most of the fake news is meant to show a agenda, belief, cause confusion or it is profits the publisher.</p>

<p>Fake news in Social Media may masquerade as reputable sources of information while it's not. This can decieve people into trusting them. If the Fake news is provided wrong or false this can sow distrust within media, governments and people.</p>

<p>Fake news in social media is different from news sources from media journalists because usually media and journalists that are usually vetted and follow a strict code of practices, have a reputation behind them. However fake news in social media in facebook, twitter, youtube Tiktok etc information from them can come from anonymous people that don't need to show their faces, and their sources of information. Information shared within social media apps don't have to be edited, fact-checked or regulated. Because of these reasons news in social media can be spreaded faster than the news by media outlets, journalists or newspapers.</p>
    
<p>Most of the Fake news in social media is focused on a particular group of people. This can split individual groups and stimulate belief. This may encourage discord and violence amongst certain groups of people.</p>
	<p><em>E.g. What is the level of analysis - culture or organization; Responsibility - individual or pro fessional; Ethical issue - power or equity; Technology - medical, nuclear, mobile?</p></em>
