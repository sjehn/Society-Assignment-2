    <p>Reflecting on our findings, I have expanded my knowledge on free speech and how it is abused to spread fake news in social media. 
	This complex relationship between free speech and fake news has also allowed a better understanding of how ethical issues may affect the credibility of information and how the spread of false information may harm others. 
	One ethical issue with fake news in social media is credibility and public trust. This heavily affects social media platforms, as users are reliant on the information spread throughout
	these platforms. Knowing that these virtual platforms may possibly spread false information, it makes users confused about which information is correct, therefore losing trust in the platform.
	Another ethical issue that is present with the introduction of fake news in social media are biased opinions. When providing information regarding topics like elections and politics online, people may exclude extremely important and legitimate information and
	also add new and false information with the objective to potentially sabotage a specific group or party. Users may also filter out information about a specific party and spread false information that may get them more supporters. Both scenarios leads to biased
opinions. By providing false information that may either make a group look bad or make a group look more appealing, individuals and even organizations can manipulate the public's perception and influence people's political choices, contributing the possible downfall of society. 
Another ethical issue is the harm that the spread of false information gives to people. Due to the misleading information, the general public start to feel fear and anger, resulting in harm towards individuals and communities. Reflecting on these issues, I have broadened my understanding of the risks that come with free speech in social media,
and how the spread of fake news heavily affects society. In order to mitigate and remove these issues, it is evident that everyone including governments, fact-checkers and society must work together in order to find an effective solution to these issues. This is may be something like improving media literacy and disencouraging biased opinions based solely
on algorithmic and uneducated decisions. On the topic of education, I also believe that while some social media platforms are regarded as " sources. accurate and reliable", it's always important that you fact-check yourself, wether by the use of fact-checking websites or books/articles. Education plays an important role as it enables users to evaluate information they have and compare their knowledge with other sources.</p>
<p> In conclusion, by exploring the relationship between free speech and fake news in social media, we can make a simpler and broader understanding of the urgency of not only technological and political issues, but also the ethical issues that come with it. Through the evaluation and reflection of our found ethical issues, it is clear that the principles of ethics and the responsibility and reliability of digital information are most relevant today and are important factors that 
must be looked into further to keep a truthful and healthy society.</p>
