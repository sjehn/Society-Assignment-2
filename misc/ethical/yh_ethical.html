<h3>Ethical Reflection</h3>
<h3>You Heng 22185565</h3>
<p>Our research into fake news in social media made me realise that although that social media is a good thing which allows many people to communicate without the concern for distance or without personal backlash on their real lifes it does have negatives. One of these negatives is the increase of fake news. Fake news is not a new thing it has been a thing for long time in our past and its going to be still there in our future. However since advent of social media there has been a considerable spread of fake news across the social media platforms. Fake news that came from social medias for example Twitter, Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook and etc is more faster to spread and gain steam on these platforms, since they don't have to rigourously be fact-checked and therefore can be published and spread faster than normal media.</p>

<p>Fake news is harmful as it could make people distrustful of the government, media and other people. As more fake news comes out as fake news people begins to distrust one other. Fake news can mislead people into believing in wrong things, for example climate change denial, and the covid-19 crisis. Fake news can be polarizing eachother by creating 'echo chambers' making us believe what we want to believe sometimes these beliefs are wrong and is harmful to society and it may encourage violence and crimes amongst eachother. Fake news can impact public opinion and elections.</p>
    
<p>There are solutions to solving this issue however some of these solutions can be harmful. Governmental regulation on social media companies into reducing fake news, may reduce the spread of fake news. However it can grow into governmental overreach and overcensorship. This can threaten the right of free speech.</p>

<p>In conclusion we must find ways of fighting against fake news but however we must strike a delicate balance between reducing fake news and protecting the right of free speech.</p>
