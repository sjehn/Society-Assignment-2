<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Free Speech - Fake News in Social Media<p></h4>
<h5> Opportunities</h5>
    <p>Although the challenge of fake news in social media is present in the introduction of free speech, the fundamental concept itself has given various opportunities for people.</p> 
	<p>-Free speech has contributed much in today's society, as it has given oppressed groups a voice to express themselves and has acted as a driving force for social movements throughout the years.</p>
	<p>Free speech has served as a powerful tool for people and communities that have been oppressed and marginalized from the past and until now, wether these oppressed groups are based on gender, sexual orientation, race, or other factors. They have the opportunity to raise their voice through different spaces and share the struggles
	they have encountered throughout their lives and demand equality in our society. A good example of this would be the Black Lives Matter movement, which was an international activist movement that campaigns against violence and systematic racism
and to bring justice and freedom to black people across the globe.</p>

<p>-Free speech has also made the advancement of science, culture and politics in our society possible:
<p>Through freedom of speech, scientists are able to openly debate and critique each other's works, enabling them to process accurate and reliable research and information from one another.
It also encourages scientists to explore unconventional and unexplored theories, leading to new researches and discoveries. Because free speech fosters the exploration of new ideas, this is also an encouragment in intellectual growth. This 
process gives the people a wider perspective on various ideas and also allows for critical thinking. By having a broader perspective, innovation and problem-solving skills are also enhanced. This could be very useful for educational purposes, like academic institutions, which
rely on free speech to create an environment open to the discussions of scholars and share their wisdom to others.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech has also made cultural exchange between different regions possible, allowing for the diversity of traditions and languages. Through the advancement of culture, artists have also been given the freedom to express themselves. This can be
done through music, poems and such. This allows them to talk about and challenge societal norms through their artistic freedom.
Through cultural advancement, the discussion of historical events that can even be painful or controverial has been made possible and is considered essential for understanding ours and others' past and history, ensuring to keep its memory and never be forgotten.</p>
<p>Free Speech has allowed citizens to engage in political process and debates. It ensures that they can freely discuss political ideas and opinions. It also enables citizes to criticize their government and possibly question authority. Political movements also rely on free speech in order to advance, making the ability of free
speech a vital factor for influencing and encouraging change and helps in making educated decisions during electionsâ€‹.</p>
<p>-Another opportunity given by free speech is healthcare. Both patients and doctors or healthcare professionals use their freedom of speech to provide quality healthcare and also talk about their concerns on some medical practices. They may also use their freedom of speech to encourage better healthcare policies. An example would be research done by the Sociology of Health & Illness, stating that health social movements (HSMs) advocates for better healthcare policies by
uniting and voicing their opinions as a collective and bring attention to important healthcare issues. This movement aims to raise awareness about health issues like AIDS, environmental justice and women's health. Health social movements engage with government officals and urge them to implement changes to healthcare policies.
